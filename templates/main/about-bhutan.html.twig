            <p>Bhutan has rich and diverse flora and fauna with over 70 percent forest coverage and wide range of
                altitude and climate. Forest types include Fir forests, mixed conifer forest blue pine, Chirpine forest,
                and broad leaf mixed with conifer, upland hardwood forest, lowland hardwood and tropical lowland
                forests. Bhutan can be divided into three ecological zones:</p>

            <p>The southern foothills, which is situated in Subtropical Zone (150m to 2000m) with Tropical or
                Subtropical vegetation. The Temperate Zone (2000 to 4000m) with conifer or broadleaf forests covers most
                parts of the country; and The Alpine Zone (4000m and above) with no forest cover, at the northern
                Himalayan regions.</p>

            <p>Over 60 percent of the common plant species of the Eastern Himalayas are found in Bhutan. The forest
                type consists of mixed conifer forest, fir forest chirpine forest, blue pine forest, broadleaf mixed
                with conifers, tropical lowland forests, lowland hardwood forest and upland hardwood forest. Bhutan has
                a very rich species of flora ranging from altitudes as low as 200m to as high as 4000m. Over 5500
                species of vascular plants have been recorded till date including 46 species of Rhododendrons and 369
                species of Orchids. The Bhutan Himalayas is also important source of valuable medicinal plants used in
                ayurvedic medicine so much so that a National Institute of Traditional Medicine has been established at
                Thimphu. High altitude in Bhutan is home to animals like Snow leopard, blue sheep, red panda, tiger,
                takin, marmot and musk deer. Temperate zone fauna include Tiger, leopard, goral, gray langur, Himalayan
                black beer, red panda, sambur, wild pig, and barking deer. The tropical forests in the south have tiger,
                clouded leopard, elephants, one horned Rhinoceros, water buffalo, golden langur, gaur, swamp deer, hog
                deer horn bills etc. Black necked crane, Green-backed tit, Plumbeous water Redstart and Oriental Turtle
                Dove are some of the popular birds found in Bhutan.</p>

            <b>Climate</b>
            <p>The three relief zones (the foothills, the central Himalayan valleys and the High Himalayas) also define
                three climatic regions: tropical, temperate with monsoon and alpine with monsoon. The southern part of
                Bhutan is tropical and the east of Bhutan is warmer than the west. The central valleys of Punakha,
                Wangdiphodrang, Monggar, Trashigang and lhuntse enjoy a semi-tropical climate with very cool winter
                while
                Thimphu, Trongsa and Bumthang have a much harsher climate with heavy monsoon rains in the summer and
                heavy
                snowfall in the winter. Winter in Bhutan starts from (mid-November till mid-March), the climate is dry
                with
                the daytime temperature falling between 16-18C (60-65F) and night temperature falling below zero. The
                spring
                season (mid March to mid June) offers warmer temperatures falling between 27-29C (80-84F). Monsoon
                usually
                arrives in mid-June, with light rain falling mainly in the afternoons and evenings. The best season for
                trekking is in autumn which arrives at the end of September which will then last until mid-November.</p>

                <b>Food</b><br>
                <p>Traditional Bhutanese food is hot and spicy. However to suite your needs, Chinese, Indian, and
                    Continental dishes are also available. The more adventurous can try the local delicacies like the
                    tasty and fiery national dish of Bhutan, Emma Datshi which is made with chillies and local Bhutanese
                    cheese. Meals are normally served buffet style in the hotels. Please give some advance notice of any
                    special dietary requirements so that we can make appropriate arrangements when the catering team
                    assembles provisions. All meals while you trek or visit in Bhutan are also included in the daily
                    tour cost.
                </p>
                <b>Electricity</b><br>
                <p>In Bhutan, electricity runs on 220/240 volts, with round hole two-pin and three-pin power outlets. In
                    Thimphu, electrical appliance shops stock adapter plugs, but they are unlikely to be available
                    elsewhere.

                <b>Communications</b><br>
                <p>Internet cafes are more widespread in western part of Bhutan and IDD calling booths can be found even
                    in the remote far east of the country. IDD calls may be made and received at most accommodations
                    used by Tashi Tours & Travels, and internet facilities are readily accessible.
                </p>
                <b>Clothing</b><br>
                <p>Due to the wide range of temperature and climatic conditions it is advisable to dress in layers. For
                    protection against cold, layered clothing is better than one or two thick garments. Clothing should
                    preferably be made from natural materials, which allow the body to breathe. You will be offending
                    people if you walk around in skimpy or tight fitting clothes. Shorts are not welcomed and women are
                    advised to wear below the knee skirts or fairly loose trousers. Dress modestly and respectfully for
                    visits to monasteries, dzongs and other religious institutions. Hats, caps etc. should be removed
                    before entering the premises.
                </p>

            <p>Bhutanâs early history is steeped in mythology and remains obscure. It may have been inhabited as early
                as 2000 B.C., but not much was known until the introduction of Tibetan Buddhism in the 9th century A.D.
                when turmoil in Tibet forced many monks to flee to Bhutan. In the 12th century A.D., the Drukpa Kagyupa
                school was established and remains the dominant form of Buddhism in Bhutan today. The countryâs
                political history is intimately tied to its religious history and the relations among the various
                monastic schools and monasteries. Bhutan is one of the only countries which has been independent
                throughout its history, never conquered, occupied, or governed by an outside power. Although there has
                been speculation that it was under the Kamarupa Kingdom or the Tibetan Empire in the 7th to 9th
                centuries, firm evidence is lacking.</p>

            <p>From the time historical records are clear, Bhutan has continuously and successfully defended its
                sovereignty. The consolidation of Bhutan occurred in 1616 when Ngawanag Namgyal, a man (lama) from
                Tibet, defeated three Tibetan invasions, subjugated rival religious schools, codified an intricate and
                comprehensive system of law, and established himself as ruler (Shabdrung) over a system of
                ecclesiastical and civil administrators. After his death, infighting and civil war eroded the power of
                the shabdrung for the next 200 years when in 1885, Ugyen Wangchuck was able to consolidate power and
                cultivated closer ties with the British in India. In 1907, Ugyen Wangchuck was elected as the hereditary
                ruler of Bhutan, crowned on December 17, 1907, and installed as the head of state Druk Gyalpo (Dragon
                King).</p>

            <p>In 1910, King Ugyen and the British signed the Treaty of Punakha which provided that British India would
                not interfere in the internal affairs of Bhutan if the country accepted external advice in its external
                relations. When Ugyen Wangchuck died in 1926, his son Jigme Wangchuck became the next ruler, and when
                India gained independence in 1947, the new Indian Government recognized Bhutan as an independent
                country.</p>

            <p>In 1949, India and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship, which provided that India would not
                interfere in Bhutanâs internal affairs but would be guided by India in its foreign policy. Succeeded in
                1952 by his son Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, Bhutan began to slowly emerge from its isolation and began a
                program of planned development. Bhutan became a member of the United Nations in 1971, and the National
                Assembly was established and a new code of law, as well as the Royal Bhutanese Army and the High Court.
            </p>

            <p>In 1972, Jigme Singye Wanchuck ascended the throne at age 16. He emphasized modern education,
                decentralization of governance, the development of hydroelectricity and tourism and improvements in
                rural developments. He was perhaps best known internationally for his overarching development philosophy
                of âGross National Happiness.â It recognizes that there are many dimensions to development and that
                economic goals alone are not sufficient. Satisfied with Bhutanâs transitioning democratization process,
                he abdicated in December 2006 rather than wait until the promulgation of the new constitution in 2008.
                His son, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, became King upon his abdication.</p>

            <p>Bhutan is the only country in the world where Buddhism is the official religion and is endorsed by the
                government. Buddhism is practiced through out the country. All most all the Bhutanese are Buddhist.
                Approximately two-thirds to three-quarters of the population practice Drukpa Kagyupa or Ningmapa
                Buddhism, both of which are disciplines of Mahayana Buddhism. Approximately one-quarter of the
                population is ethnic Nepalese and practice Hinduism. Christians and non-religious groups comprise less
                than 1 percent of the population. Before the arrival of Buddhism to Bhutan, various forms of animistic
                religion such as bonism were followed by people in Bhutan. In some parts of the country, we can still
                see, these traditions and rituals are still practiced by minority groups. Guru Rinpoche brought Buddhism
                to Bhutan in 8th century. After this, Bhutan has become home to many sages and saints. Some of the key
                figures of the Bhutanese Buddhism are Kuenkhen Longchen Ramjam, Phojo Drukgom Zhigpo, Drukpa Kuenley,
                Zhabdrung Ngwang Namgyel and Gyalse Tenzin Rabgye.</p>

            <p>Bhutanâs artistic tradition has its roots in Buddhism with almost all representation in the arts running
                along the prevailing theme of struggle between good and evil. Bhutanese art is mostly symbolic. It is
                highly decorative and ornamental. The Buddhist nature of Bhutanâs artistic heritage may be traced to
                Pema Lingpa, the great 15th Century terton (treasure discoverer), who was an accomplished painter,
                sculptor, xylographer, and architect. In 1680, Desi Tenzin Rabgye opened the school of Zorig Chusum to
                teach 13 types of Bhutanese arts and crafts under the instruction of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel. Such
                promotion of traditional Bhutanese art has been preserved through the centuries, with continued
                patronage provided by the Royal family, nobility and clergy. The common people, who depend on the
                artisans for a wide variety of metal and wooden objects indispensable to typical Bhutanese households,
                provide active support to the arts.The artist is often a religious man who creates the work commissioned
                by a Jinda or patron.</p>
            <p>Paintings and sculpture are made by groups of artists working in special workshops executed by monks or
                laymen. The basic preliminary work is done by the disciples, after which the master carries out the
                finishing touch of fine details.</p>
            <b>The 13 types of Bhutanese arts and crafts are:</b>
            <ul>

            <p>Festivals in Bhutan are celebrated as religious rituals, they are held on ground which is purified and
                consecrated by religious heads. All participants of the religious rituals are either monks or laymen. It
                is said that they perform in a complete state of meditation helping them transform themselves into the
                deities which they represent in various dances. Bhutanese believe that the performers generate a
                spiritual power, which cleanses, purifies, enlightens and blesses each and everyone witnessing the
                ceremony. It should be understood that disrespectful or impolite behaviour is unacceptable to the
                Bhutanese people while observing festivals within the country. Please note to observe common courtesy in

            <p>Bhutan has rich and diverse flora and fauna with over 70 percent forest coverage and wide range of
                altitude and climate. Forest types include Fir forests, mixed conifer forest blue pine, Chirpine forest,
                and broad leaf mixed with conifer, upland hardwood forest, lowland hardwood and tropical lowland
                forests. Bhutan can be divided into three ecological zones:
            </p>
            <p>The southern foothills, which is situated in Subtropical Zone (150m to 2000m) with Tropical or
                Subtropical vegetation. The Temperate Zone (2000 to 4000m) with conifer or broadleaf forests covers most
                parts of the country; and The Alpine Zone (4000m and above) with no forest cover, at the northern
                Himalayan regions.
            </p>
            <p>Over 60 percent of the common plant species of the Eastern Himalayas are found in Bhutan. The forest type
                consists of mixed conifer forest, fir forest chirpine forest, blue pine forest, broadleaf mixed with
                conifers, tropical lowland forests, lowland hardwood forest and upland hardwood forest. Bhutan has a
                very rich species of flora ranging from altitudes as low as 200m to as high as 4000m. Over 5500 species
                of vascular plants have been recorded till date including 46 species of Rhododendrons and 369 species of
                Orchids. The Bhutan Himalayas is also important source of valuable medicinal plants used in ayurvedic
                medicine so much so that a National Institute of Traditional Medicine has been established at Thimphu.
                High altitude in Bhutan is home to animals like Snow leopard, blue sheep, red panda, tiger, takin,
                marmot and musk deer. Temperate zone fauna include Tiger, leopard, goral, gray langur, Himalayan black

            <p>Over the years, Bhutan has cultivated a unique approach to development with its national philosophy
                anchored to the principle of Gross national happinessÂ (GNH) which was coined by the Fourth Druk Gyalpo,
                His majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck in 1972. It refers to a set of social and economic interventions that
                evaluate societal change in terms of the collective happiness of people and that lead to the adoption of
                policies aimed at that objective. Premised on the belief that all human beings aspire happiness in one
                way or another, the concept promotes collective happiness of the society as the ultimate goal of
                development. Bhutan believes that the holistic development of the individual and society can be achieved
                only through a sustainable balance between the economic, social, emotional, spiritual and cultural needs
                of the people. Development initiatives based on GNH values are therefore not restricted to the present
                population of any given society; it includes future generations and other societies, indeed all sentient
                beings. GNH has been Bhutanâs overarching development philosophy that has guided the countryâs
                development policies and programs. Guided by this policy, the country has made rapid development in a
                short period of time. Achievements have come with very minimal impact on its culture and environment.
                The government of Bhutan implemented these policies through strict adherence to the four pillars which
                includes equitable and sustainable socio-economic development; preservation and promotion of its
                culture, conservation of environment and promotion of good governance. Courtesy: facts about BhutanÂ
                Lily Wangchuck The four pillars of GNH are the promotion of sustainable development, preservation and
                promotion of cultural values, conservation of the natural environment, and establishment of good
                governance.</p>
